## Vertical Takeoff

### Procedure

1. Trim controls to neutral. Hover scan.

1. Smoothly raise collective until reaching hover altitude
   1. When light on the skids, stabilize and trim
   1. Eliminate drift with cyclic
   1. Maintain heading with pedals

### Amplifying Information

1. Check surrounding clear of obstacles. Maintain constant heading when leaving the ground. Pick object far away to help with this.

1. Once its light on the skids, it may drift and turn right. Hold colletive constant and eliminate drift with cyclic and slight adjustment with pedals.

> Note: You are in a transition to flight at this point and very susceptible to wind gusts

1. Stabilize and trim at five feet. Very slight pressures, once trimmed, will keep the aircraft in place.

1. Altitude and Attitude only require very small inputs

1. Don't taxi, takeoff, or land when an aircraft in an adjacent spot is starting or is at a very low N<sub>r</sub> during shutdown.

## Hover

### Procedure

1. Use pedals to maintain heading, collective for altitude (five feet), and cyclic over a reference point.

1. Scan
   1. Out - heading and attitude
   1. Down - altitude and drift
   1. In - N<sub>r</sub> and engine instruments

### Amplifying Information

1. Requires high degree of concentration and coordination. 

1. Use very small control inputs. Keep the collective relatively constant to help control yaw and cyclic corrections. Five foot hover is used to keep the tail stinger approximately six feet of ground clearance and ample tail rotor clearance for maneuvering

1. To maintain a hover, look for small changes in altitude and attitude. Main reference should be fairly far away. Don't stare, this could lead to over-controlling.

## Vertical Landing

### Procedure

1. Smoothly lower collective for slow rate of descent.

1. Use pedals to maintain heading and cyclic for drift.

1. Rate of descent may slow or stop near ground. Continue with slight collective pressure

1. On the ground, smoothly lower collective to full down.

> Note: In a no-wind condition, it will be necessary to displace the cyclic to the left to overcome the anti-torque thrust from the tail rotor and prevent the aircraft from drifting right. Because of this, the helo will take off right skid first and land left skid first.

### Amplifying Information

1. Relax and make smooth and timely corrections. 

1. Rate of descent may slow or stop near ground. This is due to ground effect.

1. Constantly cross check all visual references. Don't dump the collective once skids are on the ground.

## Turn on the spot/Clearing Turn

### Procedure

1. From a hover, slow turn using appropriate pedal. 

1. Adjust cyclic to remain over reference point. Use pedals to control rate of turn.

1. Stop turn at desired heading.

### Amplifying Information

1. Main rotor thrust vector can be considered an extension of the cyclic. This is especially important when winds are a factor (which they always are).

## Hover Taxi/Air Taxi

Hover Taxi: Airspeed less than 20 KTS.

Air Taxi: less than 100' AGL. Safe airspeed.

### Procedure

1. From hover, displace cyclic in desired direction.

1. Use pedals to maintain heading, collective to control altitude, and cyclic to maintain desired rate of movement.

1. Hover taxi at a reasonable speed such that a safe landing can be made in the event of power loss.

### Amplifying Information

1. Sufficient cyclic in desired direction is defined as enough to establish a slow rate of movement. 

1. If crosswind, apply lateral cyclic into the wind.

1. Combination of collective pitch and cyclic governs starting, stopping, and rate of speed while taxiing.

1. Taxi signals are advisory only, except for "HOLD" which is mandatory.

1. Hover taxi at or below walking speed within line area.
