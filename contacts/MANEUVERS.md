## Vertical Takeoff

### Procedure

1. Trim controls to neutral. Hover scan.

1. Smoothly raise collective until reaching hover altitude
   1. When light on the skids, stabilize and trim
   1. Eliminate drift with cyclic
   1. Maintain heading with pedals

### Amplifying Information

1. Check surrounding clear of obstacles. Maintain constant heading when leaving the ground. Pick object far away to help with this.

1. Once its light on the skids, it may drift and turn right. Hold colletive constant and eliminate drift with cyclic and slight adjustment with pedals.

> Note: You are in a transition to flight at this point and very susceptible to wind gusts

1. Stabilize and trim at five feet. Very slight pressures, once trimmed, will keep the aircraft in place.

1. Altitude and Attitude only require very small inputs

1. Don't taxi, takeoff, or land when an aircraft in an adjacent spot is starting or is at a very low N<sub>r</sub> during shutdown.

## Hover

### Procedure

1. Use pedals to maintain heading, collective for altitude (five feet), and cyclic over a reference point.

1. Scan
   1. Out - heading and attitude
   1. Down - altitude and drift
   1. In - N<sub>r</sub> and engine instruments

### Amplifying Information

1. Requires high degree of concentration and coordination.

1. Use very small control inputs. Keep the collective relatively constant to help control yaw and cyclic corrections. Five foot hover is used to keep the tail stinger approximately six feet of ground clearance and ample tail rotor clearance for maneuvering

1. To maintain a hover, look for small changes in altitude and attitude. Main reference should be fairly far away. Don't stare, this could lead to over-controlling.

## Vertical Landing

### Procedure

1. Smoothly lower collective for slow rate of descent.

1. Use pedals to maintain heading and cyclic for drift.

1. Rate of descent may slow or stop near ground. Continue with slight collective pressure

1. On the ground, smoothly lower collective to full down.

> Note: In a no-wind condition, it will be necessary to displace the cyclic to the left to overcome the anti-torque thrust from the tail rotor and prevent the aircraft from drifting right. Because of this, the helo will take off right skid first and land left skid first.

### Amplifying Information

1. Relax and make smooth and timely corrections.

1. Rate of descent may slow or stop near ground. This is due to ground effect.

1. Constantly cross check all visual references. Don't dump the collective once skids are on the ground.

## Turn on the spot/Clearing Turn

### Procedure

1. From a hover, slow turn using appropriate pedal.

1. Adjust cyclic to remain over reference point. Use pedals to control rate of turn.

1. Stop turn at desired heading.

### Amplifying Information

1. Main rotor thrust vector can be considered an extension of the cyclic. This is especially important when winds are a factor (which they always are).

## Hover Taxi/Air Taxi

Hover Taxi: Airspeed less than 20 KTS.

Air Taxi: less than 100' AGL. Safe airspeed.

### Procedure

1. From hover, displace cyclic in desired direction.

1. Use pedals to maintain heading, collective to control altitude, and cyclic to maintain desired rate of movement.

1. Hover taxi at a reasonable speed such that a safe landing can be made in the event of power loss.

### Amplifying Information

1. Sufficient cyclic in desired direction is defined as enough to establish a slow rate of movement.

1. If crosswind, apply lateral cyclic into the wind.

1. Combination of collective pitch and cyclic governs starting, stopping, and rate of speed while taxiing.

1. Taxi signals are advisory only, except for "HOLD" which is mandatory.

1. Hover taxi at or below walking speed within line area.

## Square Patterns

### Procedure

#### Constant-Heading

1. From start, move laterally in either direction
1. At each corner, stop and stabilize, then continue in either direction
1. When moving laterally, heading should be perpendicular to square side
1. Moving forward or rearward, square side should be under the aircraft to provide reference.

#### Parallel-Heading

1. From start, move forward onto square, turn 90&deg; right to parallel side, then air taxi
1. Hover at corner with next side abeam shoulder
1. 90&deg; turn on the spot to parallel new side, stabilize hover, continue air taxi.
1. Continue unti reaching middle of downwind side, turn 90&deg; and taxi rearward to starting position

#### Perpendicular-Heading

1. From start, slow lateral movement in either direction along square. Heading perpedicular to square.
1. Coordinate cyclic and rudder to turn on corners to maintain perpendicular heading. Do not stop lateral movement.
1. Continue until reaching the starting position


### Amplifying Information

 - All square patterns are performed at hover altitude
 - All started in the middle of the downwind side with heading perpendicular to the side
 - Starting distance should be sufficient to scan side over the instrument panel
 - Be aware of tendency to get low in turns
 - As the tail passes through the wind line the nose will tend to tuck. Be aware.
 - Parallel and perpendicular squares shall not be performed in winds exceeding 15 KTS

## Transition to Forward Flight

### Procedure

1. From hover, begin forward motion
1. Add collective if needed to prevent settling when leaving ground effect
1. Accelerate through 40 KIAS with 20' AGL
1. Passing 50' and 65 KTS adjust nose to 70 KTS attitude, climb at 500-700 fpm
1. 50' below desired altitude, adjust nose to cruise attitude. Maintain power.
1. Approaching desired airspeed, adjust collective to level off

### Amplifying Information

 - At an OLF, make clearing turn.
 - Collective increase may be required when moving the cyclic forward as some of the vertical lift is being used for thrust
 - Passing through translational lift (10-15 KTS) results in considerable increase in lift and aircraft will yaw left and slightly up. This is predicated by a moderate vibration or shudder throughout the helicopter. Apply additional forward cyclic to overcome this effect.

## Max Load Takeoff

### Procedure

1. Hover into courseline. Check and state N<sub>g</sub> required for hover.
1. Clearing turn and land
1. Raise collective to just clear the ground and stabilize
1. Begin slow forward movement, still in ground effect
1. Add power to prevent settling
1. Passing through translational lift, adjust cyclic to prevent excessive climb
1. Maneuver complete when 40 KIAS at no higher than 20' AGL. Announce.

### Amplifying Information

 - Hover into the wind at 5' and check N<sub>g</sub> required to maintain hover. This is simulated threshold for maneuver.
 - When just clear of the ground, power required should not yet equal simulated power available
 - DO NOT RUSH FORWARD FLIGHT

## No Hover Takeoff

### Procedure

1. From hover, clearing turn and land
1. Trim controls to neutral and hover scan
1. Smoothly raise collective in a continuous pull not to exceed 85% torque
1. As the helicopter leaves the ground, forward cyclic
1. Reach translational lift asap while maintaining safe ground clearance
1. At 40 KIAS, adjust power and intercept normal forward flight parameters

### Amplifying Information

 - Do not hesitate or stop once collective pull has started until reaching max power available as rotor wash will quickly lift debris
 - Rate of forward cyclic must be slow to prevent excessive nose low

## Normal Cruise

### Procedure

1. Set cruise attitude with cyclic and altitude with collective
1. Use pedals

### Amplifying Information

 - Normal cruise (100 KIAS) is typically 70-75% torque
 - Attitude and VSI are primary items for normal cruise

1. 50' prior, collective increase to level off

## Level Speed Change

### Procedure

1. Establish 100 KTS cruise flight at given altitude >500'
1. Slow to 70 KTS and stabilize
1. Accelerate to 100 KTS

### Amplifying Information

1. Can be executed from any airspeed, but typically its done from 100 KTS
1. At 100 KIAS torque will be (70-75%). Slowing to 70 KIAS will require reduction in torque past torque required to maintain 70 KIAS (50-55%) and vice versa

## Turn Pattern

### Procedure

1. 45&deg; AOB for 360&deg; of heading change; reverse
1. Roll wings level on original heading, altitude, and airspeed

### Amplifying Information

1. For 15&deg; AOB, little or no power changes
1. For 30&deg; AOB, additional power may be required
1. For 45&deg; AOB, definite power increase will be required

## Normal Approach

**Pause** - check 500-700 fpm

**Trim** - use trim to keep balanced flight

**Turn** - clear left and right, then begin turn

1. After intercepting courseline with 800-1000' of final, the minimum acceptable glideslope of 25&deg; will be at ~550' from intended point of landing. Max 45&deg; will be ~300'.

1. Groundspeed is controlled with nose attitude and rate of descent is controlled with collective

## Waveoff - Power On

### Procedure

1. Ensure twist grip full open
1. Collective, increase to arrest rate of descent
1. Establish 70 KTS 500-700fpm climb

### Amplifying Information

1. Recover by accelerating to 50 KTS

### Amplifying Information

1. Begin from stable hover, transitioning to forward flight
1. Use airspeed indicator to judge 50 KTS, don't use altimeter to measure 35'
1. Airspeed indicator unreliable below 40 KIAS
1. Quality determined by smoothness and control coordination. Don't rush it, it's not quick or a stop

## Sliding Landing

### Procedure

1. Utilize normal approach procedures
1. Intercept final, adjust nose and attitude to decel, maintain translational lift (13-15 KTS)
1. At 5-10' AGL, level skids with 3-15 KTS GS
1. After touchdown, smoothly lower collective to gradually stop, then full down.

### Amplifying Information

**Level skids, forward and down**

1. Desired speed at touchdown depends on condition of landing surface
1. Must remain in effective translational lift until touchdown attitude

> Warning: failure to align aircraft with direction of travel may result in dynamic rollover

> Caution: Excessive GS with uneven terrain may result in excessive rocking of the aircraft and potential driveshaft-to-isolation mount contact

> Caution: Reduction of the collective at an excessive rate and/or magnitude upon touchdown may result in the skids digging in and the aircraft rocking forward precipitously

## No Hover Landing

### Procedure

1. Utilize normal or steep approach procedures
1. Approaching ground effect, adjust collective to continue descent with little or no GS

### Amplifying Information

**Level skids, forward and down**

1. Fly pattern at a comfortable airspeed (similar to normal approach) and terminate in a five-foot hover taxi with five KTS of GS
1. When stable in a hover taxi, IP will assume control and student will switch hyd switch On when instructed

### Amplifying Information

1. Increased force will be required for control movements and considerable coupling between cyclic and collective can be noticed
1. Collective additions are easier than reductions
1. Make smooth control inputs
1. Force trim still usable

## Simulated Engine Failure in a Hover and Hover Taxi

1. Intercept courseline
1. Ensure collective full down by 150' AGL
1. 75-100' AGL, flare with cyclic (this reduces rate of descent and groundspeed and increases N<sub>r</sub>)
   1. Power Recover: smoothly rotate twist grip to full open and verbalize "TWIST GRIP FULL OPEN"
   1. Full: verbalize "TWIST GRIP AT FLIGHT IDLE"
1. Adjust flare for GS and minimize rate of descent

1. Arrive at courseline with a min of 200', else waveoff
1. Don't delay turn to courseline (you're giving up altitude)
1. Scan pattern ditty for inside-outside: **attitude, N<sub>r</sub>, ball**
1. N<sub>r</sub> (90-107%) ideally 94-95%
   1. Use up collective to slow N<sub>r</sub> during turns
1. With no N<sub>r</sub>, helicopter falls like brick
1. Smoothly lower collective (as to not cause mast bumping) to maintain N<sub>r</sub>
1. Use the inertia stored in rotor blades at bottom of the autorotation to produce the necessary lift to properly cushion the landing

1. At the site, terminate with power recovery unless otherwise directed
1. Priority of Actions:
   1. Enter auto
   1. Pick landing site
   1. Consider wind

## Checking Power Available at Altitude

### Procedure

1. Raise collective until VSI centers on zero or N<sub>r</sub> decays to 90%
   1. If VSI doesn't level with N<sub>r</sub> at or above 90%, decelerate or accelerate to 50 KIAS
   1. If cannont maintain level flight at 50 KIAS and N<sub>r</sub> at or above 90%, then power available is insufficient
1. If VSI is at zero and N<sub>r</sub> greater than 90%, then power available is sufficient

Sufficient Power Available: VSI at 0 when 50+ KIAS **AND** N<sub>r</sub> 90+%
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Amplifying Information

1. First check VSI by raising the collective to find 90% N<sub>r</sub> and stop moving the collective, if that still doesn't get you level flight, while maintaining N<sub>r</sub> in limits, adjust nose to 50 KIAS
1. DO NOT BRING THE TWIST GRIP TO FLIGHT IDLE
1. When power is available, determine landing type (vertical, no-hover, sliding) and select site based on landing type
1. Slowly raise the collective until an operating limit is reached (N<sub>g</sub>, TOT, torque) and note if N<sub>r</sub> decays to 90% while attempting to reach that limit, the torque setting at this point is now max available to land
1. Compare this torque available with torque required to hover to determine landing type needed
