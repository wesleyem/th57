## NVG human factors

NVGs don't turn night into day. Must always be crosschecked with other instruments

## visual performance

1. Spatial Orientation
    1. Requires complex and conscious processing of data from various instruments and displays. Constant vigilance and good scan pattern inside and outside must be maintained to help prevent spatial disorientation.
1. Field of View
    1. 40&deg; with goggles; 180&deg; without
    1. Active, agressive scan required to overcome limited FOV.
    1. Too close to eyes and lose look under ability, too far and lose some FOV
1. Visual Acuity and Resolution
    1. Will begin to lose contrast when ambient light levels decrease beyond the capabiliity of the image intensifier tube's ABC.
    1. Contrast will also be reduced when a bright light source enters the FOV
1. Additional Visual Cues
    1. Depth perception is different than distance estimation. Depth is easy to get.
    1. Optical flow can create the illusion of movement in various directions leading to spatial d
    1. Peripheral vision aka motion parallax is a subconscious method of detecting optical flow
1. Dark Adaptation
    1. after removal of NVGs approx 10 min required to adapt to unaided night environment
1. Unaided peripheral cueing
    1. what can be seen depends on illumination level, terrain type, and aritificial light sources
1. Post-Flight Visual Problems
    1. No evidence of permanent changes to vision

## fatigue

1. acute
    1. feeling worn out
    1. relieved by a single nights rest
1. cumulative
    1. feeling burned out
    1. longer than one nights rest to cure
1. circadian
    1. The body's biological clock
    1. can be adjusted

## complacency/overconfidence

1. NVGs don't turn night into day
1. Trust but verify
1. Treat NVG visual display with healthy disrespect and crosscheck with other instruments

## flight operations with NVDs (OPNAV)

1. Dash last has Anticollision on pos steady bright
1. All crew must be on the same type of goggles
    1. AN/AVS-9 can be mixed with Mini-Quadeye Night Vision Cueing Displays (NVCDs)
1. Interior A/C lighting should be compatible to the max extent possible
