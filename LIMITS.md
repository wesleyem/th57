# Limits

## Engine Limitations

### Engine Oil Pressure
|Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> below 79%	| Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> 79-94%	| Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> above 94%	| Max |
|---|---|---|---|
50 psi	| 90 psi	| 115 psi	| 130 psi except 150 immediately following cold-wx start


### Engine Oil Temperature

0&deg; to 107&deg;C

### Nf

Power On:

|Min 	| Max |
|---|---|
|97% 	|	100%|

> Note: N<sub>f</sub> overspeeds are determined on a sliding scale depending on TOT, N<sub>f</sub> percentage, and duration

Avoid Range (steady-state operation)
 - 71-88% with engine torque greater than 33%
> Note: Steady state is defined as holding N<sub>f</sub> within a 2% range
> Note: Holding N<sub>f</sub> in this range for 60 cumulative seconds requires turbine replacement and shall be avoided

### Ng RPM
Idle	|	Normal	|	Max
---|---|---
|	62 +/- 2|	59-105	|	106 for 15s	|

### Rotor Engagement/Disengagement Wind Limitations

### Turbine Outlet Temperatures

##### During Start

| Range | Time Limit |
|---|---|
| Up to 810 &deg;C | No limit |
| 810 &deg;C to 927 &deg;C | 10s max |
| 927 &deg;C | Max |

##### During power transient

| Range | Time Limit |
|---|---|
| Up to 738 &deg;C | No limit|
| 738 &deg;C to 810 &deg;C  | 5 min |
| 810 &deg;C to 843 &deg;C | 6 sec |
| 843 &deg;C | Max |

### Fuel

 - Maintain OAT above freezing point of fuel in use
 - Min fuel reserve requirement for TH-57B/C is 10 gallons

 > Caution: Airframe and engine fuel filters may become blocked if fuel is chilled below its specific freezing point.
