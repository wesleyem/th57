## Engine Limitations

### Engine Oil Pressure
|Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> below 79%	| Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> 79-94%	| Min w/ N<sub>g</sub> above 94%	| Max |
|---|---|---|---|
50 psi	| 90 psi	| 115 psi	| 130 psi except 150 immediately following cold-wx start


### Engine Oil Temperature

0&deg; to 107&deg;C

### Nf

Power On:

|Min 	| Max |
|---|---|
|97% 	|	100%|

> Note: N<sub>f</sub> overspeeds are determined on a sliding scale depending on TOT, N<sub>f</sub> percentage, and duration

Avoid Range (steady-state operation)
 - 71-88% with engine torque greater than 33%
> Note: Steady state is defined as holding N<sub>f</sub> within a 2% range
> Note: Holding N<sub>f</sub> in this range for 60 cumulative seconds requires turbine replacement and shall be avoided

### Ng RPM
Idle	|	Normal	|	Max
---|---|---
|	62 +/- 2|	59-105	|	106 for 15s	|
