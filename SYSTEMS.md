### Introduction to the TH-57
#### General
 - Bell 206B Jet Ranger
 - Land-based, skid-configured utility type helicopter
 - Designed for reasonably level terrain
 - Roll Royce 250-C20J Turboshaft engine
 - Main rotor diameter `33'4''`
 - Max T/O gross `3200 lbs`
 - Max forward A/S (std cond) `130 kts`
 - Max sideward A/S (std cond) `25 kts`
 - Max rearward A/S (std cond) `15 kts`

#### Airframe
 - Forward/cabin
   - Aluminum honeycomb covered with fiberglass or aluminum skin
 - Landing Gear
   - Tail skid is stressed for loads of `200 lbs downward` or `400 lbs upward`
 - Cowling
   - 4 sections : foward, induction, engine and aft fairings
 - Tail boom
   - Full monocoque aluminum structure
   - Main purpose is to `"provide an extended support to mount the tail rotor"`
   - Other functions : supporting horizontal stab, vert fin section, tail rotor drive shaft, and tail rotor gearbox
   - Horizontal stab is mounted at the mid point with negative camber
 - Vertical fin
   - semimonocoque aluminum honeycomb/skin
   - `5.5 degree` offset from longitudinal axis assists in countering torque

#### Cargo Hook
 - Structural weight capacity of `1500 lbs` (lift capability may be much less)
 - 3 release mechanisms
   - `electrical` switch on either cyclic activates solenoid on the hook assembly
   - `mechanical` "T" handle connected to a cable assembly attached to the hook
   - `mechanical` located on the hook itself used by the ground handler

#### Lighting Systems
All aircraft light systems (Figure 1-8) are DC powered. Lights are protected by circuit breakers and circuit breaker type switches.

#### Pitot System
 - Pitot tube : suplies impact air to the a/s indicator
 - Heater : (electric) prevents ice from obstructing the pitot tube
 - Static ports : located on each side of the fuselage fwd of cabin doors
 - Tubing : steel tubing to connect pitot tube and static ports
 - Altimeter : senses static pressure from static ports
 - VSI : actuated by the rate of atmospheric pressure change ; vented to the static air system
 - A/S indicator : delta(impact air px/static px)
 - 

#### Seat Restraints, Doors, and Caution Panel
##### Seat
 - Pilot & Copilot
   - lap belts and interia reel shoulder harness with manual lock-unlock handle (handle located on left side of both seats)
   - In unlocked position, systems allows pilot to lean foward until a longitudinal impact and deceleration force of `2-3Gs`

##### Doors
 - Both cockpit doors are jettisonable in an emergency or removable during external lifts

##### Caution Panel
 - Located on instrument panel
 - Protected by the `CAUTION LT` c/b
