#### Compressor Section
 
![Image][systems-2-2]
 4 subassemblies
 - Front support

    Aerodynamically designed air inlet with seven hollow struts and front bearings for the rotor. Hollow struts are part of the anti-ice system. Struts serve as inlet guide vanes, which ensure air strikes the first stage compressor at the proper angle

 - Compressor rotor blades and wheels

    Six-stage axial compressor and one-stage centrifugal compressor. A bleed air control valve is mounted on the 5th stage of the compressor. By the time the air is collected in the diffuser scroll, is has been compressed to `6.5` times ambient pressure and has risen to a temperature of `500 degrees` Fahrenheit. The compressor bleed air system is an entirely automatic system. It bleeds air off the compressor during `starting, acceleration, and at low compressor pressure ratio operation`.

 - Case assemblies
 - Diffuser scroll

    Contains ports for air to be bled for [anti-icing](#anti-ice-system), cabin heat, and a compressor discharge air pressure [(monitored by the fuel control system)](#engine-controls). Ducts the compressed air to the combustion chamber via itself and two air transfer tubes.

---

#### Combustion Section

![Image][systems-2-6]

 - Where the air and fuel mix to go boom
 - 250-C20J has single "can" type combustion chamber
 - Fuel nozzle and igniter plug is mounted in the aft end
 - `75%` of air passes between the inner liner and combustion case which is used for cooling the combustion chamber
 - `25%` enters combustion liner, mixes with fuel, and goes boom.
 - During starting, fuel-air mix is ignited by the capacitor-type igniter plug adjacent to the fuel nozzle
 - Once the engine is started, combustion is self-sustaining
 - A `burner drain valve` is the lowest point in combustion section and drains any fuel that may collect in the chamber after shutdown

---

#### Turbine Section

 - Converts heat to mechanical energy
 - 2-stage gas producer turbine
    - N<sub>g</sub> or N<sub>1</sub>
 - 2-stage free power turbine
    - N<sub>f</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>

Expanding gases from the `combustion section` first enter the `gas producer turbine` where about `2/3` of the energy drives the `compressor section` and the `gas producer drive train`. Most of the remaining `1/3` energy powers the `free power drive train` by way of the `free power turbine`. The remaining gases are collected by the `exhaust collector` and discharged into the atmosphere.

Engine Temperature Measuring
 - 4 probes sense the temperature of the gases on the outlet of the `gas producer turbine`
 - DC voltage directly proportional to the gas temperature is generated by each thermocouple probe.
    - 28V DC power is still needed to operate the cockpit gauge

---

#### Accessory Gearbox

 - Provides mounting and support for the [compressor](#compressor-section) and [turbine](#turbine-section) assemblies
 - 4 engine mounting pads; top pad used to mount the anti-icing motor

Accessories driven by `gas producer turbine`:
 - <u>S</u> - Starter-Generator
 - <u>T</u> - Tachometer-Generator (N<sub>g</sub>)
 - <u>O</u> - Oil pump
 - <u>F</u> - Fuel Control
 - <u>F</u> - Fuel Pump
 - <u>S</u> - Standby Generator (TH-57C)

Accessories driven by the `free power turbine`:
 - <u>G</u> - Governor (N<sub>f</sub>)
 - <u>O</u> - Output Shaft (Power)
 - <u>T</u> - Tachometer-Generator (N<sub>f</sub>)
 - <u>T</u> - Torquemeter

The Torquemeter assembly is located in the accessory gearbox.

`torque developed` -> `helical gear` -> `proportional oil pressure` -> `transducer` -> `electrical voltage` -> `DC powered torque gauge`

The `Power Output Gear` is where the `power turbine` energy is transmitted to the `freewheeling unit` to drive the rotor system.

#### Oil Tank Reservoir

Capacity: `5.5 quarts`
Checking Oil Level:
 - Sight gauge on the left side of reservoir
 - Dipstick mounted in filler cap on right side of the aircraft
    - Only way to determine exact oil level

    The `freewheeling unit` is pressure lubricated by the `transmission oil system`. Since the freewheeling unit is mounted at the power output gear, the two oil systems are only separated by oil seals.

    An `overfull condition` is caused by a oil seal failure which allows transmission oil to enter the engine oil system. The sight gauge wil not indicate if the oil level is ABOVE the gauge, just that it's at the gauge. The only indication of a seal failure will be the `overfull` reading on the dipstick.

 - Engine Oil Pump
    - Gear type
    - 1 pressure element
    - 4 scavenge elements
    - driven by N<sub>g</sub> gear train with direct relationship

 - External Oil Filter
    - Body
       - Disposable filter element 
    - Head
       - Bypass provision
       - When oil bypasses, the pressure will pop a red indicator button out which can be viewed through the inspection door near the left side of the oil tank
    - After the oil is filtered it is routed to a `radiator type oil cooler`

 - Radiator Type Oil Cooler
    - Oil flow is regulated by a `temperature control valve`
       - `approximately 160/71 &deg;F/&deg;C` the valve starts to open
    - Cooling air is provided by a `"squirrel cage type fan"` driven by the `tail rotor drive shaft system`
       - also provides cooling air for `transmission oil and hydraulic fluid`

`FIRE DET TEST` switch is used to test the proper functioning of the `ENG FIRE` bulb, electrical circuitry, and sensing element integrity.

---

#### Engine Failure Warning System

`ENG OUT` warning light and audible tone is activated when N<sub>g</sub> drops below `55+/-3 percent` RPM.
 - The sensor is connected to the N<sub>g</sub> [tachometer-generator](#accessory-gearbox)

`ROTOR LOW RPM` caution light and audible tone is activated when N<sub>r</sub> drops below `90+/-3 percent` RPM.

### Main Rotor, Tail Totor, and Flight Control System

#### Main Rotor Assembly

##### Major Components

 - Splined trunnion
 - Yoke
 - Tension torsion-straps
 - Blade Grips
 - Pitch Change Horns
 - Flap Restraint Assembly (kit)
 - Main Rotor Blades

##### Splined Trunnion

Mounted to the mast and provides the mounting point for the yoke assembly and flapping axis for the main rotor.

##### Yoke

Mounted to the splined trunnion by pillow blocks which allow the main rotor to flap. Mounting point for the yoke is above the centerline. This (undersling) corrects for geometric imbalance caused by tilting the rotor system. The yoke has `2 1/4&deg;` of preconing which helps relieve bending stress.

##### Tension Torsion Strap

Attached to inboard part of yoke by a retention cap and pin. It's made up of many wires around two spools with a rubber coating. The strap holds the blade grip to the yoke assembly via a latch bolt. The strap twists and absorbs centrifugal forces that allow pitch change action.

##### Blade Grips

Provide mounting point for rotor blades and pitch change horns. Mounted to the Yoke by the Tension Torsion Strap.

##### Pitch Change Horns

Receive inputs from pitch control tube which cause blade grips to change pitch around the yoke assembly. 

##### Flap Restraint Assembly

Prevents excessive flapping. Mounted at the top of the splined trunnion. Is a flyweight and spring type restraint. At low rotor RPM springs hold restraint in tension. As RPM increase, flyweights overcome spring and full flap is allowed.

##### Main Rotor Blades

Mounted to the Blade Grips by hollow Through Bolts. They are hollow to allow for balance weights to be installed. Blades are nonsymetrical droop snoot design composed of an aluminum allow nose block, trailing edge, and skin sheets over an aluminum honeycomb fiber. Strength is increased by bonding doublers (laminations) at the root. Weights are added at the tip and mid-span to help with autorotation. Excessive blade flapping can cause damage to the tail boom especially at low rotor RPM.

#### ![Image][c]Rotor Brake

#### Tail Rotor Assembly

Counteracts the main rotor torque effect. Main rotor blade rotate CCW which makes the fuselage attempt to rotate CW.

 - two-bladed, semi rigid, flapping type system
 - blades are all metal (aluminum honeycomb covered by SS skin)

###### Major Components

 - Rotor blades
    - aluminum honeycomb covered by SS skin
    - diameter is 5'5"
    - mounted to yoke by retention block
    - has ballast stations for mass balancing
       - spanwise balancing: washers on blade bolts
       - chordwise balancing: weights and washers on trunnion bearing housing retaining bolts
 - pitch change horns
    - mounted to tail rotor blade
    - receives input from cross head via pitch change links
 - cross head
    - mounted to control tube
 - control tube
    - as extends or retracts cross head moves the pitch change links
 - balance wheel
    - used for dynamic balancing
    - mounted on tail rotor gearbox shaft
 - static stop
    - limits amount of flapping by tail rotor
 - yoke assembly
    - forged alumnium alloy
    - mounted to gearbox shaft by splined trunnion
    - Geometric balance is accomplished by an offset between the splined trunnion and the yoke assembly
       - trunnion is attached to yoke assembly at an angle less than 90&deg; to the span of the blades

#### Cyclic Control

As the cyclic is moved, the rotor disc tilts in the direction of movement. At the base of cyclic and part of the pivot support assembly, a friction adjuster allows pilot to adjust desired cyclic friction. Pilot and Co-Pilot pivot supports are connected by a torque tube.

The swashplate assembly consists of a stationary swashplate, rotating swashplate, pivot sleeve, swashplate support, and a drive link.

![Image][systems-5-13]

The top of the pivot sleeve is of a uni-ball construction. It's the mounting point for the stationary swashplate. This is what allows the stationary swashplate to tilt in any direction. Rotating swash is mounted to stationary swash by bearings and bearing cap. A drive link is spline mounted to the mast at one end and to the rotating swash at the other.

The drive link lever and collar causes the rotating swash to rotate at the same speed with the rotor system. Rotating swash is attached to the pitch change horns by two pitch control tubes.

**Moving the cyclic forward will cause the stationary swash to tilt forward. The rotating swash will tilt with the stationary. A low point front and high point rear is created when the swash is tilted foward. As the rotating swash rotates, the pitch change tubes move up on the high side and down on the low side. As a pitch change tube moves upward, blade pitch angle increases, and as it moves downward blade pitch angle decreases. The retreating blade climbs and the advancing blade descends.**

##### Control Input Flow

Cyclic transmits controls to the mixing lever (located at the base of the control column). Inputs are intermixed and transmitted up the control column to hydraulic servos. Manual input is hydraulically boosted to the stationary swashplate. Stationary swashplate transmits controls to the rotating contols (rotating swashplate, pitch change tubes, and pitch change horns).
