![Image][figure2-1]

#### Compressor Section
 
![Image][figure2-2]
 4 subassemblies
 - Front support

    Aerodynamically designed air inlet with seven hollow struts and front bearings for the rotor. Hollow struts are part of the anti-ice system. Struts serve as inlet guide vanes, which ensure air strikes the first stage compressor at the proper angle

 - Compressor rotor blades and wheels

    Six-stage axial compressor and one-stage centrifugal compressor. A bleed air control valve is mounted on the 5th stage of the compressor. By the time the air is collected in the diffuser scroll, is has been compressed to `6.5` times ambient pressure and has risen to a temperature of `500 degrees` Fahrenheit. The compressor bleed air system is an entirely automatic system

 - Case assemblies
 - Diffuser scroll

    Contains ports for air to be bled for [anti-icing](#anti-ice-system), cabin heat, and a compressor discharge air pressure [(monitored by the fuel control system)](#engine-controls)

#### Combustion Section

![Image][figure2-6]

 - Where the air and fuel mix to go boom
 - 250-C20J has single "can" type combustion chamber
 - `75%` of air passes between the inner liner and combustion case which is used for cooling the combustion chamber
 - `25%` enters combustion liner, mixes with fuel, and goes boom.

#### Turbine Section

 - Converts heat to mechanical energy
 - 2-stage gas producer turbine
    - N<sub>g</sub> and N<sub>1</sub>
 - 2-stage free power turbine
    - N<sub>f</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>

Expanding gases from the `combustion section` first enter the `gas producer turbine` where about `2/3` of the energy drives the compressor section and the `gas producer drive train`. Most of the remaining `1/3` energy powers the `free power drive train` by way of the `free power turbine`. The remaining gases are collected by the `exhaust collector` and discharged into the atmosphere.

Engine Temperature Measuring
 - 4 probes sense the temperature of the gases on the outlet of the `gas producer turbine`
 - DC voltage directly proportional to the gas temperature is generated by each thermocouple probe.
    - 28V DC power is still needed to operate the cockpit gauge

#### Accessory Gearbox

 - Provides mounting and support for the [compressor](#compressor-section) and [turbine](#turbine-section) assemblies
 - 4 engine mounting pads; top pad used to mount the anti-icing motor

Accessories driven by `gas producer turbine`:
 - <u>S</u> - Starter-Generator
 - <u>T</u> - Tachometer-Generator (N<sub>g</sub>)
 - <u>O</u> - Oil pump
 - <u>F</u> - Fuel Control
 - <u>F</u> - Fuel Pump
 - <u>S</u> - Standby Generator (TH-57C)

Accessories drive by the `free power turbine`:
 - <u>G</u> - Governor (N<sub>f</sub>)
 - <u>O</u> - Output Shaft (Power)
 - <u>T</u> - Tachometer-Generator (N<sub>f</sub>)
 - <u>T</u> - Torquemeter

The Torquemeter assembly is located in the accessory gearbox.

`torque developed` -> `helical gear` -> `proportional oil pressure` -> `transducer` -> `electrical voltage` -> `DC powered torque gauge`

The `Power Output Gear` is where the `power turbine` energy is transmitted to the `freewheeling unit` to drive the rotor system.


#### Engine Oil System

Pressurized circulating dry sump-type oil system

 - Components
    - Reservoir
    - Oil pump
    - Internal filter
    - External filter
    - Oil cooler

![Image][figure2-12]
![Image][figure2-13]

#### Oil Tank Reservoir

Capacity: `5.5 quarts`
Checking Oil Level:
 - Sight gauge on the left side of reservoir
 - Dipstick mounted in filler cap on right side of the aircraft
    - Only way to determine exact oil level

    The `freewheeling unit` is pressure lubricated by the `transmission oil system`. Since the freewheeling unit is mounted at the power output gear, the two oil systems are only separated by oil seals.

    An `overfull condition` is caused by a oil seal failure which allows transmission oil to enter the engine oil system. The sight gauge wil not indicated if the oil level is ABOVE the gauge, just that it's at the gauge. The only indication of a seal failure will be the `overfull` reading on the dipstick.

 - Engine Oil Pump
    - Gear type
    - 1 pressure element
    - 4 scavenge elements
    - driven by [N<sub>g</sub> gear train](#accessory-gearbox) with direct relationship
    - delivers oil under pressure to the `internal oil filter`

 - Internal Oil Filter
    - Pressure regulating valve
    - Filter element
    - Differential pressure bypass valve
    - Delivered to the engine by way of the `gearbox housing passage` and `oil pressure sensing port` through a one-way check valve
 
After the oil is delivered to the engine components it will drain into the sump areas.

 - Sump areas
    - Oil is then picked up by scavenge system and delivered aft to the `external oil filter` and `oil cooler`

 - External Oil Filter
    - Body
       - Disposable filter element 
    - Head
       - Bypass provision
       - When oil bypasses, the pressure will pop a red indicator button out which can be viewed through the inspection door near the left side of the oil tank
    - After the oil is filtered it is routed to a `radiator type oil cooler`

 - Radiator Type Oil Cooler
    - Oil flow is regulated by a `temperature control valve`
       - `approximately 160/71 degrees F/C` the valve starts to open
    - Cooling air is provided by a `"squirrel cage type fan"` driven by the `tail rotor drive shaft system`
       - also provides cooling air for `transmission oil and hydraulic fluid`

#### Engine Oil System Monitors

 - Temperature
    - monitored with pressure by a dual gauge on the instrument panel
    - temperature bulb in `engine oil tank`
    - sends electrical signals to temperature gauge
 - Pressure `(aka Wet-line system)`
    - monitored with temperature by a dual gauge on the instrument panel
    - pressure sensing port in oil system downstream of `internal filter`
    - connected directly to the pressure gauge by piping
 - Metal Particles
    - 2 magnetic chip detectors mounted in the [accessory gearbox](#accessory-gearbox)
    - triggers the `engine chip light` to illuminate
    - smaller particles can be 'pulsed' off by depressing the chip light
    - larger particles cannot be 'pulsed' off
    - frequent chip lights extinguished by 'pulsing' may be significant

#### Anti-Ice System

Used to prevent ice formation on the [`compressor front support`](#compressor-section). System operation selectable by pilot. Air used for this system comes from the bleed air from the diffuser scroll in the [`compressor section`](#compressor-section)

#### Engine Fire Detector System

`ENG FIRE` warning light activates on the caution panel if excessive heat is sensed from the sensing tube located in the engine compartment. This trips a pressure switch which activates the light.

`FIRE DET TEST` switch is used to test the proper functioning of the `ENG FIRE` bulb, electrical circuitry, and sensing element integrity.

#### Engine Failure Warning System

`ENG OUT` warning light and audible tone is activated when N<sub>g</sub> drops below `55+/-3 percent` RPM.
 - The sensor is connected to the N<sub>g</sub> [tachometer-generator](#accessory-gearbox)

`ROTOR LOW RPM` caution light and audible tone is activated when N<sub>r</sub> drops below `90+/-3 percent` RPM.
 - The sensor is connected to the N<sub>r</sub> [tachometer-generator](#accessory-gearbox)
 - A sensing switch on the collective disables the audio unit when the collective is approx 1 inch of full down position

 - Audio mute switch
    - Location: caution panel (left)
    - silences headset warning for `ENG OUT` and `ROTOR LOW RPM`
    - CABIN WARNING HORS REMAIN FUNCTIONAL

#### Engine Controls

See section 213

#### Meters and Gauges

###### Turbine Outlet Temperature Indicator

`TOT` gauge receives information from four sets of thermocouples on the [engine turbine section](#turbine-section).

Receives power from the:
 - TH-57B Common BUS
 - TH-57C Essential #2 BUS

###### Gas Producter Tachometer

Shows RPM of the [gas power turbine](#turbine-section).

Receives power by the gas producer tachometer-generator.

###### Dual Tachometer

Needle marked `T` indicates power turbine RPM (N<sub>f</sub>).
Needle marked `R` indicates main rotor RPM (N<sub>r</sub>)

Receives input from two tachometer-generators

###### Engine Oil and Pressure Gauge

Temperature Gauge is connected to an electrical resistance-type bulb located in the engine oil tank.

Pressure gauge is a wet-line system requiring no electrical power
