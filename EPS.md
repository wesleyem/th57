# Emergency Procedures

## Engine

---
### Abort Start

1. Twist grip ... **Close**
1. Starter ... **Secure after TOT stabilizes at 400 &deg;C or below**

1. Collective ... **Lower**
    > Note: Power (collective) reduction will often eliminate compressor stalls.
2. ENG Anti-ice switch ... **ON**
3. Cabin Heat Valve ... **ON**
4. Check power available

##### If power is insufficient to maintain level flight:

5. Autorotate
6. Twist grip ... **Flight Idle**

##### If power is sufficient to maintain level flight:

7. Land as soon as possible

---
### Engine Overspeed (Nf) Rotor RPM (Nr)

##### If time and altitude permit:

2. Transmit position and intentions
3. Unnecessary electrical equipment ... **Secure**

### Hydraulic Power Cylinder Malfunction

1. HYDRAULIC BOOST switch ... **OFF**
   > Warning: Hydraulic system will not secure if HYD BOOST circuit breaker is out

2. Helicopter ... **Regain control**

1. Establish positive G load and/or balanced flight (as required)
2. Land immediately

---
### Uncommanded Right Roll During Flight Below 1G

1. Cyclic ... **Immediately apply aft to establish positive G load on rotor, then center laterally**

##### When main rotor returns to a positive thrust condition:

2. Controls ... **As required to regain balanced flight**

##### If mast bumping has occured:

---
### Fixed Pitch (Low Power)

Fixed Pitch Pedal in a Hover - Right Yaw:
##### If rate of rotation is not excessive and landing surface is smooth and firm:

1. Collective ... **Decrease to effect a power-on landing**

##### If rate of rotation is excessive or landing surface is unsuitable for a power-on landing:

2. Twist grip ... **Reduce as nose approaches windline**
3. Cyclic ... **Eliminate drift**
4. Collective ... **Increase to cushion landing**

Fixed Pitch Pedal at Altitude - Lower Power steps are non-memory items.

> Warning: If it becomes necessary to use large collective inputs to waveoff near the deck, the nose will yaw right and possibly enter uncontrolled flight

---
### Fixed Pitch (High Power)

Fixed Pitch Pedal in a Hover - Left Yaw:

##### If rate of rotation is not excessive and landing surface is smooth and firm:

1. Collective ... **Decrease to effect a power-on landing**

##### If rate of rotation is excessive or landing surface is unsuitable for a power-on landing:

2. Smoothly increase collective to stop the left yaw
3. When the left yaw has stopped, smoothly decrease collective to set up for a landing
4. Eliminate lateral drift with cyclic as the aircraft settles
5. Continue to smoothly lower collective once on deck to control yaw and transfer aircraft weight to the skids.

Fixed Pitch Pedal at Altitude - High Power steps are non-memory items.

---
### Loss of Tail Rotor Effectiveness

##### If vibrations continue:

2. Land as soon as possible

   > Warning: Be prepared to execute Complete Loss of Tail Rotor Thrust procedures
   > Warning: Increased power settings required to accomplish a normal approach may ultimately precipitate the complete failure of a malfunctioning tail rotor. Be prepared for uncommanded right yaw in the event of complete loss of tail toro thrust during the approach. Consideration should be given to maintaining an autorotative profile or low-powered approach.

---
### Complete Loss of Tail Rotor Thrust

##### In a hover:

1. Twist grip ... **Flight idle**
2. Cyclic ... **Eliminate drift**
3. Collective ... **Increase to cushion landing**
