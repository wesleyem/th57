> Note: Check the transmission oil pressure with the twist grip full open. Illumination of the TRANS OIL PRESS caution light is common, while the twist grip is as flight idle; however, the gauge should indicate positive transmission oil pressure.

> Note: There is no detrimental effect to the transmission system with oil pressure between 50 to 70 psi with transmission temperature within limits. Pressure indications between 50 to 70 psi shall be documented on a MAF upon completion of flight.
