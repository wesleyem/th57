### Introduction to the TH-57
#### General
 - Bell 206B Jet Ranger
 - Land-based, skid-configured utility type helicopter
 - Designed for reasonably level terrain
 - Roll Royce 250-C20J Turboshaft engine
 - Main rotor diameter 33'4''
 - Max T/O gross 3200 lbs.
 - Max forward A/S (std cond) 130 kts
 - Max sideward A/S (std cond) 25 kts
 - Max rearward A/S (std cond) 15 kts
#### Airframe
 - Forward/cabin
 -- Aluminum honeycomb covered with fiberglass or aluminum skin
 - Landing Gear
 -- Tail skid is stressed for loads of 200 lbs downward or 400 lbs upward
 - Cowling
 -- 4 sections : foward, induction, engine and aft fairings
 - Tail boom
 -- Full monocoque aluminum structure
 -- Main purpose is to "provide an extended support to mount the tail rotor"
 -- Other functions : supporting horizontal stab, vert fin section, tail rotor drive shaft, and tail rotor gearbox
 -- Horizontal stab is mounted at the mid point with negative camber
 - Vertical fin
 -- semimonocoque aluminum honeycomb/skin
 -- 5.5 degree offset from longitudinal axis assists in countering torque
#### Cargo Hook
 - Structural weight capacity of 1500 lbs (lift capability may be much less)
 - 3 release mechanisms
 -- (electrical) switch on either cyclic activates solenoid on the hook assembly
 -- (mechanical) "T" handle connected to a cable assembly attached to the hook
 -- (mechanical) located on the hook itself used by the ground handler
#### Lighting Systems
All aircraft light systems (Figure 1-8) are DC powered. Lights are protected by circuit breakers and circuit breaker type switches.

#### Pitot System
 - Pitot tube : suplies impact air to the a/s indicator
 - Heater : (electric) prevents ice from obstructing the pitot tube
 - Static ports : located on each side of the fuselage fwd of cabin doors
 - Tubing : steel tubing to connect pitot tube and static ports
 - Altimeter : senses static pressure from static ports
 - VSI : actuated by the rate of atmospheric pressure change ; vented to the static air system
 - A/S indicator : delta(impact air px/static px)
 - 
 #### Seat Restraints, Doors, and Caution Panel
##### Seat
 - Pilot & Copilot
 -- lap belts and interia reel shoulder harness with manual lock-unlock handle (handle located on left side of both seats)
 -- In unlocked position, systems allows pilot to lean foward until a longitudinal impact and deceleration force of 2-3Gs
##### Doors
 - Both cockpit doors are jettisonable in an emergency or removable during external lifts
##### Caution Panel
 - Located on instrument panel
 - Protected by the CAUTION LT c/b
